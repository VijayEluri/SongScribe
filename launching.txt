Launching SongScribe

SongScribe needs Java 5 to run.
If you want to launch SongScribe from command line there are two ways.
If you just type java -jar songscribe.jar, a window will appear where you
can select which application you want to start.

Regularly you can use the following commands to start the applications:
for Song Writer: java -Dsongscribe=sw -jar songscribe.jar
for Song Show  : java -Dsongscribe=ss -jar songscribe.jar
for Song Book  : java -Dsongscribe=sb -jar songscribe.jar

Each application has splash screen when they start. However a long time may pass while the
Java virtual machine loads, initializes. Therefore in Java 6 a quick splash screen has been introduced.
The official version of Windows uses this quick splash. Use this for enabling quick splash:
Song Writer: java -Dsongscribe=sw -splash:images/swsplash.png -jar songscribe.jar
Song Show  : java -Dsongscribe=ss -splash:images/sssplash.png -jar songscribe.jar
Song Book  : java -Dsongscribe=sb -splash:images/sbsplash.png -jar songscribe.jar
