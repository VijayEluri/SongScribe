<h1>SongScribe Tutorial</h1>
Welcome to the SongScribe tutorial. This tutorial will show you how to type and edit a song step by step.
<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>Let's start with an empty document. First we open the Composition Setting window to set up our song.
We can do this in the Composition | Composition settings menu, or simply clicking the <img src="../images/compositionsettings.png" border="1">
icon on the tool bar.
<p align="center"><img src="images/cs.png" border="0">
<p>You can type the number of the song if applicable. The title of the song will be entered later, after we have recorded the lyrics.
In the information text box we type the date of the song. Now we set up the tempo and the leading keys. From the
tempo description drop down list you can select a preset description or you can type in anything you want.
